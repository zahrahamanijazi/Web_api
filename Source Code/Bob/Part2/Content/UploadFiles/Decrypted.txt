You have implemented a simple web server in Assignment1 which receives ciphers and decrypts it based on the previously saved keys. However, in most real-world applications it is
common for the key to be decided by both parties at the time of connection using the Key
exchange methods. In this part you will use the Program You made in Part I to expand your
web server to exchange keys before connecting and send data using the acquired key. Alice
and Bob would each run an instance of the program and try to exchange keys at first. Later
on, they will start to send and receive data using the key.
